# AI-Powered Image Captioning Tool

This project implements an AI-powered image captioning tool that can generate descriptive captions for images. It utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract image features and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate natural language descriptions.

## Key Features

* **Image Feature Extraction:** Extracts meaningful features from images using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16).
* **Sequence Generation:**  Employs an LSTM network to generate captions word-by-word based on the extracted features.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes NLP techniques like tokenization and word embeddings to process and generate human-readable captions.
* **Flickr8k Dataset:** Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images and corresponding textual descriptions.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
* **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework for building and training the model.
* **NLTK:** Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
* **OpenCV:** Library for image processing and loading.

## How it Works

1. **Image Feature Extraction:** A pre-trained CNN (like VGG16) is used to extract relevant features from an input image.
2. **LSTM Model:** An LSTM network takes the extracted features as input and learns to generate a sequence of words that describe the image.
3. **Caption Generation:** The trained model takes a new image as input, extracts its features, and generates a descriptive caption.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the Flickr8k dataset and place it in the appropriate directory using `dataset.sh` or the link [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/adityajn105/flickr8k).
4. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
5. Use the `predict.py` script to generate captions for new images.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement attention mechanisms to improve caption quality.
* Experiment with different CNN architectures (ResNet, Inception) for feature extraction.
* Explore the use of transformers for caption generation.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for easier interaction.
